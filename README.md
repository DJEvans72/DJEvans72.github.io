This is a project for taking notes while studying the front end web development
with [Experience Haus](https://experiencehaus.com).

I found out that .md is using the markdown file syntax
# for heading one
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

- you can use - for bullet points

1. and can start a line with a number for numbered lists

license files cerate a mark down files
some people put contributing guidelines in a separate mark down file.
they can also be out at the bottom of the README.md
